## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
the analysis is to deternine if we can find an accurate way of predicitiong successful loans using machine learning. 

these are the finacincal metrics we had  available to make the predictions. 

loan_size	interest_rate	borrower_income	debt_to_income	num_of_accounts	derogatory_marks	total_debt	loan_status

what we needed to predict was the success of the loans using the other information. 

we went through a lineear regression in order to conuclde if we can predict loan status.

we used logistic regression and a confusion matrix
## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.


   i was unable to figureout the coding for the classification report. therefore i am unable to give you a lot of the scores. 

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:


with my inability to finish the classification report I do not think it would be approatite to make a recommendation. 


If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
 i dont recommend then becau
